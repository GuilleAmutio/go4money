## Create CRUD using SQLC

The GitHub repository of SQLC can be found https://github.com/kyleconroy/sqlc[here].

* Execute `sqlc init`, it will generate a YAML file
* Configure the settings of the YAML. See the Getting started chapter at the GitHub docs
* Create query and sqlc folders
* Define the queries inside the query folder
* Run `sqlc generate`
* This command will generate:
** `models.go` file, with the tables definition
** `db.go` file, dbtx interface
** `<tableName>.sql.go`, queries translated to Go language

## Database unit tests

In Go, test are defined by adding `_test` at the end of the name of the file. The `main_test.go` is where the connection to the database is defined. Also, the line `os.Exit(m.Run())` instructs the program that, once the tests are run, it should exit.

Each table will have its own series of queries that will make use of the `testify` package. This library allows the use of the `require` function.

Test have to be created for query.
