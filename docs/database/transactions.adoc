## Transactions

A transaction is a simple unit of work that is made up of multiple database operations

Transaction lifecycle:

* Start transaction with BEGIN command
* Once actions are performed make it permanent using the COMMIT command
* If any of the queries fail, use ROLLBACK command

Transactions follow the ACID principle:

* Atomicity: All changes to the data must be performed or none
* Consistency: Only valid data is saved
* Isolation: Transactions do not affect each other
* Durability: Written data will not be lost

### Create a transaction

Define the Store struct, this store will provide all functions to execute the DB queries. These queries are generated by SQLC in the previous section.
