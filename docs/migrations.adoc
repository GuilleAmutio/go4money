# Migrations

The database used is PostgreSQL. The schema will be generated using https://dbdiagram.io[dbdiagram.io].

To generate the migrations we will use https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate[Go Migrate].

The ORM used will be SQLC, however GORM and SQLX is a great alternative

## SQLC

The GitHub repository of SQLC can be found https://github.com/kyleconroy/sqlc[here].

* Execute `sqlc init`, it will generate a YAML file
* Configure the settings of the YAML. See the Getting started chapter at the GitHub docs
* Create query and sqlc folders
* Define the queries inside the query folder
* Run `sqlc generate`
* This command will generate:
** `models.go` file, with the tables definition
** `db.go` file, dbtx interface
** `<tableName>.sql.go`, queries translated to Go language
